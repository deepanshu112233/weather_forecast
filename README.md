# Weather Forecast

In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature using historical data. We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather. You can customize this to your own location. Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. I've used the ridge regression model for weather predictions.

## Project Steps
- Download weather data
- Data Preprocessing (Clean and graph data)
- Create a testing framework
- Improve model accuracy
